## Project 5 Information
- Gained experience working with class constructors and methods, interpreting existing code to design these classes, and working with code modules
- Gained experience executing and debugging Node.js code using module breakpoints on VSCode
- Gained experience working with Array map() and forEach() methods
- Gained experience working with gaming loop concept as well as objects and arrays

While this project was much shorter in nature, it served as a great reminder of how to work withh objects and arrays, and applied a new level of difficulty by interpreting existing code and developing my own monster class.
